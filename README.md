# Full-Stack-Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting and building the complete journey of learning and practicing Full-Stack Development. It starts as a foundation for exploring how modern applications are designed, developed, and deployed, and will gradually evolve as different technologies and concepts are added. The purpose of this project is to consolidate all practical implementations into one place, beginning with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end structure and styling, followed by learning back-end development with server-side programming, connecting with databases, and finally integrating everything into fully functional applications. Over time, the repository will include modules and mini-projects demonstrating topics like RESTful APIs, authentication, state management, database connectivity, responsive design, and deployment workflows, making it both a personal learning record and a resource for others. Anyone cloning this repository can track the progression of concepts step by step, contribute by suggesting improvements, or use the content as a roadmap for mastering full-stack development. The ultimate vision of this repository is to serve as a structured, scalable, and practical collection of work that grows alongside my learning curve while reflecting industry-standard practices in building end-to-end web applications.
